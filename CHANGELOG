- applied Diana's patch to  BBNormAna/BBNormAna.cxx
  (BBNormAna/BBNormAna-23Mar2010.diff) that adds the updated bcm calibration
  constants.
- analogous patch added to analyzer/src/THaNormAna.C



Tue Feb  2 22:09:07 EST 2010 [ Brad Sawatzky -- brads@jlab.org ]
- setting up for a 'standard' release for d2n.jlab.org
  - updated root-setup.sh with reasonable default values
  - updated replay/def.h with reasonable default values
  - cleaned up StartType.pl
    - the main 'filetimes_d2n' was moved to $DB_DIR/
    - as per convention, StartType.pl will first check for a file in the
      working directory and use that instead
  - updated makefiles to use these gcc compile options:
    '-march=core2 -mfpmath=sse'
  - stripped 'LED' subdirectory in rootfile path in replay_det_BB.C

- See 'Running multiple jobs' section in README
  - a couple helper scripts and suggestions are provided to speed analysis
    and better utilize our machine

- stripped useless LHRS VDC histo generation from BBDecData.cxx
  - updated replay_det_BB.C to use BBDecData class instead of THaDecData
  - updated replay_phys_BB.C to use BBDecData class instead of THaDecData

FIXME: THaDecData VDC efficiency histo handling seems broken (and was not touched)
    - The histogram writing code used for the 'special case' VDC efficiency
      histos seems to be fairly broken.  The TH1::Write() method seems to be
      called multiple times resulting in many duplicate copies of the histos
      being written to the root file.
