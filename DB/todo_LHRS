-- Positive Polarity calibrations need to be done, and the subsequent changes to 
   be made to the DB files 'db_L.prl1.dat', 'db_L.prl2.dat', and 'db_L.cer.dat' for 
   the gas Cerenkov and the Pion Rejector.
   
-- We need to figure out how to apply the polarity changes correctly so that runs 
   that occured just *before/after* the polarity change *do not* see the wrong 
   calibration coefficients.  The polarity changes tend to occur midday, 
   so the directories 20090302, 20090304, 20090309, 20090313 (on the LHRS side at least) 
   need to be modified to reflect such a change.  Matt and I have been in contact 
   with Xin and have his script that handles this issue, so we're working on it. 
   I have made a file labeled 'filetime_d2n' which documents the run number, 
   which database subdirectory (YYYYMMDD) it pulls information from, and the
   start time of the run.  This file will be input for the script that will switch 
   subdirectories when we encounter a polarity change or some other change midday. 

-- The LHRS physics replay still needs work as it is not operational.  In particular, 
   the kinematics calculations for pions is not working, and is the main feature 
   of the LHRS physics replay. 

-- Matt and I need to develop the coincidence physics replay. 

-- My analyzer throws the error when running 'replay_det_L.C':

   Error in <"L.trg"::OpenFile()>: Cannot open database file db_L.trg.dat

   Speaking with Brad, the 'db_L.trg.dat' file has to do with correcting for timing 
   offsets between different trigger types.  It comes from the THaTriggerTime class. 
   This has to be integrated into the analyzer properly.

-- I am currently working on getting the onlineGUI to work again, so that we may do 
   a quick check on our replays without having to run our individual scripts in full.  
   I have been in contact with Bryan Moffit (who wrote the GUI), and I have it operational 
   in principle -- but I would like to make it a bit smoother -- remove extraneous plots, and 
   have the GUI only produce the 'characteristic' ones for the LHRS, adjust the scales, etc.  
   I would rather send out the final version and directions on how to use it when I finish 
   with the fine-tuning.
