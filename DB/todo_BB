 Below is a list of things that still need to be completed for the d2n database:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Need to implement Xin's script (StartType.pl) which has the analyzer look at the time stamp on each run, which will allow for midday changes.
     -Using Xin's script will require a .txt file (filetime) that contains run number and time stamp for each run that needs
      to be analyzed in the following format:

                 run# YYYYMMDD hh:mm:ss

* The Bigbite preshower and shower need to be calibrated using 1 and 2 pass Elastic data.

* BigBite Cerenkov one photopeaks may need a little fine tuning.

* Need to find some BigBite LED runs for early Feb 2009 inorder to calibrate the 1 photo peak (can't seem to find any). 

* Need to modify THaCherenkov class to handle  multihit TDCs

* Need to set BigBite Cerenkov TDC offset coefficients

* replay_phys_BB.C script is almost in working condition, may be some problems with the .cdef file.

* Need to get a BigBite scalar replay running

* BigBite MWDC detector changes and Optic calibrations need to be included
